About the chat editor:

This chat editor is a platform on which you can create a dialogue for up to six characters that converse with each other within one chat group.

This application is a prototype of a self-developed chat editor. Anyone can write dialogues in the form of a chat and publish them. Dialogues are a literary art form that transfer well into digital form. In times of messengers and social media, the "chat form" is a common way of expressing oneself. However, with existing chat applications the intention is not to take on more than one speaker role.

Technical details

This chat editor has been developed with the MERN stack, i.e. MongoDB as the database, Express as the back end framework, React as the front end library and Nodejs as the JavaScript runtime environment. The underlying language is JavaScript. Redux was used for state management, design was implemented with CSS and React bootstrap, and authentication with Firebase.

Concept and Development:

This is my first extensive web application, conceptualised and developed as part of self-study. The project has grown organically, with major adjustments and changes in the course of development as I have enhanced my technical knowledge.

The initial idea was to create a platform to write and publish dialogues in the form of a chat, being similar in appearance to that of messengers such as Whatsapp. It is possible to reply to individual messages, which have a reference to each other. The message being replied to appears in an extra window above the current message.

The chats are initially written as a draft and are not publicly accessible. At this stage content can be edited and messages can be moved or deleted. If necessary, new participants can also be added to a chat or existing ones removed. After a chat has been published it will appear on the start page. Only the chat content itself within individual messages can be edited after publication, e.g. to correct spelling mistakes. If a chat needs major revision it can be saved again as a draft and edited.

The development of this chat editor has continuously evolved as I have enhanced my workable knowledge of web development. My ability to implement new functionalities has grown, resulting in ongoing restructuring and simplification of functions with cleaner code.
