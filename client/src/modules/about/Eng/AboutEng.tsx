                    This chat editor is a platform on which you can create a
                    dialogue for up to six characters that converse with each
                    other within one chat group.

                    This application is a prototype of a self-developed chat
                    editor. Anyone can write dialogues in the form of a chat and
                    publish them. Dialogues are a literary art form that
                    transfer well into digital form. In times of messengers and
                    social media, the "chat form" is a common way of expressing
                    oneself. However, with existing chat applications the
                    intention is not to take on more than one speaker role.

                    I have created a way for myself to write philosophical
                    thoughts about life, the self and reality. Dialogues are a
                    suitable form for me to present philosophy in a lively and
                    true-to-life way

                  <p>
                    My studies in philosophy have had a great impact on my
                    thinking and personality, although I do not intend to pursue
                    a purely academic audience. I am addressing all those who
                    are interested in and enjoy philosophy, self-reflection and
                    an exchange of ideas.

                    This is my first extensive web application, conceptualised
                    and developed as part of self-study. The project has grown
                    organically, with major adjustments and changes in the
                    course of development as I have enhanced my technical
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The initial idea was to create a platform to write and
                    publish dialogues in the form of a chat, being similar in
                    appearance to that of messengers such as Whatsapp. It is
                    possible to reply to individual messages, which have a
                    reference to each other. The message being replied to
                    appears in an extra window above the current message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The chats are initially written as a draft and are not
                    publicly accessible. At this stage content can be edited and
                    messages can be moved or deleted. If necessary, new
                    participants can also be added to a chat or existing ones
                    removed. After a chat has been published it will appear on
                    the start page. Only the chat content itself within
                    individual messages can be edited after publication, e.g. to
                    correct spelling mistakes. If a chat needs major revision it
                    can be saved again as a draft and edited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The development of this chat editor has continuously evolved
                    as I have enhanced my workable knowledge of web development.
                    My ability to implement new functionalities has grown,
                    resulting in ongoing restructuring and simplification of
                    functions with cleaner code.

                    This chat editor has been developed with the MERN stack,
                    i.e. MongoDB as the database, Express as the back end
                    framework, React as the front end library and Nodejs as the
                    JavaScript runtime environment. The underlying language is
                    JavaScript. Redux was used for state management, design was
                    implemented with CSS and React bootstrap, and authentication
                    with Firebase.

                    The editor is developed to the extent that it can write,
                    edit and permanently publish chats. However, this is only a
                    prototype of the chat editor, as further modules and
                    functions will be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example:</p>

                  <p>- search tool (topics, tags)</p>
                  <p>- links between chats</p>
                  <p>
                    - external comments on single messages/links to messages
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    - more writing and editing functions (bold, italic, add
                    pictures)
                  </p>
                  <p>- usability functions (font-size, background etc.)</p>
                  <p>
                    - development of an algorithm to “play” a chat in real time
                    (as you would watch the protagonists while chatting)
